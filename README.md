# _React JS_ ‚öõÔ∏è
- <b>React</b> begins with <b> ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)</b>

## _Runtime Environment for JS_ ‚ö°
- <b>_Deno_</b> 
- <b>_Bun_</b>

## <b>_Versions in Node JS:_</b><br>
- <b>LTS(Long Term Support)</b>: Has a release Cycle and Doesn't update everytime<br>
- <b>Current</b>: Updates very quickly as soon as any update is pushed with new features(Constant Update)


üåü **Note:**  **Node** did some breaking changes after **_Version 12_**

Before **Version 12** Node used to have some special function like **firebase functions** for free<br>
But After **Version 12** these function use to <b>take charge</b> for using them

### üåü _Go and study about_ : _Child Processes_

- Node also gives npm

## <b>_Full Forms_</b>
- **npx:** Node Package Execute<br>
- **npm:** Node Package Manager<br>
---
- Sometimes your npm version might be different and node version might be different

## _Creating a React App_

Earlier we use to install the global library, it was almost similar to installing a software in your system
> npm -g install create-react-app

<br>
Now you can imagine, you always have to install this whenever you want to create a react app<br>
This will consume a lot of space, that's a huge distadvantage<br>
Or if there is an update in the create react app then we have to reinstall it or kind of update it<br>
Earlier people use to do this way

### Q. **So for each project we have to install React again and again?**<br>
No, we have to install it <b>one time globally</b>, the it <b>works anytime</b> atleast on the system<br>

<b>But there could be a better way</b><br>
There was <b>another package introduced</b> which was <b>npx(node package exxecuter)</b><br>
With <b>npx</b> you <b>don't need to install</b> anything on the <b>system</b>,<br>
it just that **you write and command** and it will **execute that command directly from the internet**
<br>
The same way it installs other technology like <b>react-native too</b>

## _Command to create a React App_
> <b>npx create-react-app appName</b>
